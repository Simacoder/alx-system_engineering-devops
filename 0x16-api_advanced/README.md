# 0x16. API advanced

## Background Context
- Questions involving APIs are common for interviews. Sometimes they’re as simple as ‘write a Python script that queries a given endpoint’, sometimes they require you to use recursive functions and format/sort the results.
 
# Resources

- [Reddit API Documentation](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/b-4nD6hwEeNYTwYl5yWNwA)

# Tasks
# 0. How many subs?
- Write a function that queries the Reddit API and returns the number of subscribers (not active users, total subscribers) for a given subreddit. If an invalid subreddit is given, the function should return 0.

# 1. Top Ten
- Write a function that queries the Reddit API and prints the titles of the first 10 hot posts listed for a given subreddit.

# 2. Recurse it!
- Write a recursive function that queries the Reddit API and returns a list containing the titles of all hot articles for a given subreddit. If no results are found for the given subreddit, the function should return None.

# 3. Count it!
- Write a recursive function that queries the Reddit API, parses the title of all hot articles, and prints a sorted count of given keywords (case-insensitive, delimited by spaces. Javascript should count as javascript, but java should not).
