# 0x0D. Web stack debugging #0

# Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:

- [Network basics](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/33)
- [Docker](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/65)
- [Web stack debugging](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/68)

## Background Context
- The Webstack debugging series will train you in the art of debugging. Computers and software rarely work the way we want (that’s the “fun” part of the job!).

- Being able to debug a webstack is essential for a Full-Stack Software Engineer, and it takes practice to be a master of it.

# Tasks
# 0. Give me a page!
- Be sure to read the Docker concept page

In this first debugging project, you will need to get Apache to run on the container and to return a page containing Hello Holberton when querying the root of it.
