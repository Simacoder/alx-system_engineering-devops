# Tasks

# 0. ARP spoofing and sniffing unencrypted traffic
- Security is a vast topic, and network security is an important part of it. A lot of very sensitive information goes over networks that are used by many people, and some people might have bad intentions.

# 1. Dictionary attack
- Password-based authentication systems can be easily broken by using a dictionary attack (you’ll have to find your own password dictionary). Let’s try it on an SSH account.
