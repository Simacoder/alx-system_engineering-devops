# Tasks
# 0. Install MySQL
- First things first, let’s get MySQL installed on both your web-01 and web-02 servers.
# 1. Let us in!
- In order for us to verify that your servers are properly configured, we need you to create a user and password for both MySQL databases which will allow the checker access to them.

# 2. If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes
- In order for you to set up replication, you’ll need to have a database with at least one table and one row in your primary MySQL server (web-01) to replicate from.
# 3. Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?
- Before you get started with your primary-replica synchronization, you need one more thing in place. On your primary MySQL server (web-01), create a new user for the replica server.
# 4. Setup a Primary-Replica infrastructure using MySQL
- Having a replica member on for your MySQL database has 2 advantages:
# 5. MySQL backup
- What if the data center where both your primary and replica database servers are hosted are down because of a power outage or even worse: flooding, fire? Then all your data would inaccessible or lost.
